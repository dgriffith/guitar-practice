      "name": "Down Strums Only",
      "instructions": "Hold a G chord. Strum down on every beat — 1, 2, 3, 4. Keep your strumming arm moving in a steady, relaxed motion. Focus on hitting all the strings evenly. Try this on G, then C, then D.",

      "name": "Down-Up Pattern",
      "instructions": "Keep your arm moving in constant down-up motion like a pendulum. Strum: Down-Up-Down-Up on every eighth note. The key insight: your arm never stops moving — you just choose when to make contact with the strings.",

      "name": "Syncopated Pattern",
      "instructions": "The classic folk/rock pattern: Down, Down-Up, Up-Down-Up (D, D-U, U-D-U). In count: 1, 2-and, and-4-and. Your arm still moves constantly — you skip the strum on beat 3 (arm moves down but misses strings).",

      "name": "Muted Strums (Chucking)",
      "instructions": "Hold a chord but lightly release pressure with your fretting hand to mute the strings on specific beats. Play: Strum-Mute-Strum-Mute (strum on 1 and 3, mute/chuck on 2 and 4). This creates a percussive rhythm.",

      "notes": "The muted strum should sound like a crisp 'chk'. Don't lift your fingers completely off the strings."

      "name": "Apply to a Song",
      "instructions": "Pick a song with a simple chord progression (try G-Em-C-D or Am-F-C-G). Apply the strumming patterns you just practiced. Start with the syncopated pattern, then add muted strums for flavor.",
